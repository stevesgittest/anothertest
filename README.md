# I creaed a local repository and added a couple of files
$ I then created this account and used the account creation to create a git repository called test
I then did a "git remote add origin https://github.com/stevesgittest/test.git" which I think addes this path to the git global 
config file.
I then did a git push -u origin master which sent the local repo to github
